In dealing with various hedge funds, Vladimir & Baiju realized that big Wall Street Firms were essentially paying nothing to trade stocks, while most Americans were charged a commission for every trade that they made (https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/our-story/). Thus, the idea of Robinhood was conceptualized, as a way to provide everyone with access to the financial markets, not just the wealthy. 

In order to expedite it's growth, Robinhood released it's IPO in July of 2021, raising a total of $2.1 B at $38/share. The company has grown exponentially from a revenue and number of user standpoint, nearly doublind year-over-year since it's inception. In order to fuel this growth and expansion the company have offered a total of 28 rounds of founding, raising a total of $6.2B (https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood/company_financials)
