## **Overview & Origin**

Robinhood, which was founded by two Stanford gradutes, Vladimir Tenev & Baiju Bhatt, was founded in April of 2013. After graduating from college, Vladimir & Baiju, built and established two finance companies which sold trading software to various hedge funds.

In dealing with various hedge funds, Vladimir & Baiju realized that big Wall Street Firms were essentially paying nothing to trade stocks, while most Americans were charged a commission for every trade that they made (https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/our-story/). Thus, the idea of Robinhood was conceptualized, as a way to provide everyone with access to the financial markets, not just the wealthy.
